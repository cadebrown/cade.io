## GNU Stow: A Pretty Good Solution

If you haven't heard of [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) yet, it's a tool for managing software installations in a very flexible way. It allows you to create symlinks to software packages in a single directory, and then use that directory as a single point of entry for all your software.

You can pair that with a Git repository, which most people put in `~/dotfiles/`, and then call `stow` to install the software you want. This also allows you to track changes over time and synchronize your software across multiple machines.
