I published my first paper **Design, Optimization, and Benchmarking of Dense Linear Algebra Algorithms on AMD GPUs**, in [IEEE HPEC 2020](https://ieee-hpec.org/). This was a major project of mine at [ICL](https://icl.utk.edu) that aimed to take the existing [MAGMA](https://icl.utk.edu/magma/index.html) linear algebra library which ran on NVIDIA GPUs, and port it to AMD GPUs. Specifically, it needed to work on the [Frontier supercomputer at ORNL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)), which only has AMD GPUs.

Interestingly, my [co-name won the Turing award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dongarra). He is a legend in the HPC community, and I was very honored to work with him. I'd also like to thank [Stan Tomov](https://icl.utk.edu/~tomov/) for mentoring me and helping me get this research job.

**TL;DR: we were able to get 73% faster time-to-solution for solvers, and up to 60x faster for BLAS operations.**

We tuned various algorithms (matrix multiplication, rank-k updates) that are common building blocks of machine learning, physical simulations, and other applications. There were a number of obstacles to extracting good performance out of the new hardware; specifically the change in warp size (32 -> 64), new compiler (NVIDIA's nvcc -> AMD's ROCm/hipcc), and overall higher peak performance of newer hardware. So much of the HPC ecosystem was built around CUDA, and luckily AMD's HIP was very similar conceptually.
