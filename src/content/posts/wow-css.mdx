[^semantic]: [Semantic HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html/semantic-html) refers to the practice of using the 'correct' HTML elements for each particular purpose of the document


**CSS sucks.** There, I said it. But we have to use it, so... *just deal with it?*

Actually, it's not really CSS that sucks, but rather the hoops I have to go to just to *put the damn thing in the middle of the other thing*. I find it's often very easy to describe in natural language what I *want* to do, and even not too hard to write CSS rules that *almost* do what I want, but it is very difficult to write the rules in such a way that they generalize.

Apart from that, sometimes despite writing CSS rules that *should* work, I find out that they fail due to [browser bugs](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40786326), or just plain old quirks. Luckily, the days of Internet Explorer are behind us, but Safari/WebKit still exist. So, this effort is my blood-soaked battle against the forces of chaos and entropy that is web design.

I'm calling it `wow.css`, and ideally that single file, dropped in with well-structured semantic [^semantic] HTML will result in you being shocked and amazed at how it *just works*, and:

* Provides sane sizes, colors, and spacing for all elements
* Displays correctly and similarly in all modern browsers
* Works on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop
* Can be extended further with another file (such as `mywow.css`)

For now, I'm just developing it for my own use, in my [personal website](/). But, after I've developed and iterated on it for a while, I plan on releasing it on its own.

Let's dive in!
