If you're in the AI space, specifically generative models, you owe a great deal of respect to [VQGAN](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/) and [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip). When combined, they can be used to iteratively refine images to more closely match a prompt.


These are some results from recent work on generating art using machine learning and artificial intelligence. Most of the following are using VQGAN+CLIP, or just CLIP alone.

I gave [a presentation](/bones/CadeBrown-2021-ICL-MAGMA-AI.pdf) at UTK's Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL) that describes some of these processes.
