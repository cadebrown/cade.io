## Hey! I'm Cade 👋

Welcome to [Near Computronium](/posts), my personal website and blog!

My main interests are programming computers, researching mathematics, and writing about philosophy. I also [make music](https://dysmorphicdemiurge.bandcamp.com/), if you're into that sort of thing.

You can find me online at:

* [cade.io](https://cade.io) -- my personal website and blog
* [github.com/cadebrown](https://github.com/cadebrown) -- most of my public code
* [linkedin.com/in/cade-brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cade-brown/) -- professional networking

Currently, I'm working full time at NVIDIA on the [cuFFT library](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cufft/), to accelerate [Fast Fourier Transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) on GPUs. Specifically, I focus on performance tuning for new architectures and adopting JIT compiler technologies.

Previously, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK)](https://www.eecs.utk.edu/faculty/), and worked as a research assistant in the [Innovative Computing Lab (ICL)](https://icl.utk.edu/about). I was a research intern at [Oak Rdige National Lab (ORNL)](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/) in the supercomputing group. 

I was also [involved](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qardian-labs/) in a few [startups](https://news.utk.edu/2022/05/06/student-start-ups-awarded-funding/), which taught me some valuable lessons.

## My Music

I'm the vocalist for **Dysmorphic Demiurge**, a death metal band based in Knoxville, TN. We're unlike most death metal bands; our songs deal with the rise of artificial intelligence, the philosophical repercussions of achieving [The Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity), and also fantasy worlds.

We're completely self-recorded, self-mixed, and self-mastered. Our artwork is courtesy of [Justin Abraham](https://www.instagram.com/artofjustinabraham). We're currently signed to [Miasma Records](https://miasmarecords.com/collections/dysmorphic-demiurge).

: My opinions and suggestions on some of Python's mathematical inconsistencies. TL;DR: add `inf` and `nan`, and change how math-based exceptions are structured. */}
